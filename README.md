# RedCubeUnityAndroidTest

##Presentation

Here is a Unity Project to check out if you have fully setting up your computer to be able to compile on an Android device through Unity. This project is the result of a tutorial made by Rabidgremlin on his blog : http://blog.rabidgremlin.com/2015/01/11/tutorial-creating-your-first-unity-android-app-2015-update/

I use this project as an Hello World project to test if either Android SDK and JAVA SE are correctly intalled on my computer and ready to compile through Unity3D
